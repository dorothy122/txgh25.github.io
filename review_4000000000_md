interest of content
- good information text, nice images.

consistency and quaility of visual presentation
- not consistent formating of text throughout all the pages 
- healthcare with wheel of images is good but as the images are different sizes, the arrows move with each image. Would be better if it was consistent 
- some cool styles - nice nav bar at the top, photo and text wheels
- consistent font and colours but they could be bit mmore interesting and less boring.

quality of written presentation
- good paragraphs, informative text.
- good spelling and grammar 

validity of HTML
- empty h1 tag on healthcare page
- a few validity errors with the attributes of the image tags
- would be better to have a seperate html file so that styles are more consistent and easier to do.

evidence of collaboration
- no evidence of who did what
