        <h1><b>Computers in research</b></h1>
        <p>Through applications of computers such as simulations, automation, computation and most critically, sharing information, computers have revolutionised research in almost all fields</p>
    </div>
    <div class="container" style="margin-top: 50px">
        <h2>The information age</h2>
        <p>The main benefit of using computers within research is the incredible capability that they have for sharing information, data and <a href="communication.html">communicating</a>.</p>
        <p>As information becomes more widespread through the use of forums, online communities and collabrative apps such as<a href="https://github.com/txgh25/ProgBlackWeek4"> github</a>, the ease of learning and general education level rises due to it's accessibility. An increased amount of resources and education for young people bolsters not only the quantity of people performing research but the quality as people become more experienced much faster</p>
        <p>Moreover it allows for verification of experiments and collective advancement by sharing data collected.</p>

        <h2>Simulated world</h2>
        <p>With the rise of bigger, more powerful computers simulations have become a viable way to model and test things in the real world that may have been costly or impossible to do</p>
        <p>A great example of using computation to simulate the world is through the use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method">Monte carlo method</a> which can mimic incredibly large data sets in order to perform statistical analysis. This technique is used in a variety of fields such as physics, engineering and maths</p>
